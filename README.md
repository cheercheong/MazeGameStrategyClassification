# MazeGameStrategyClassification
Implementation of Expectationâ€“maximization (EM) algorithm in C++ to classify the strategies applied by 300 plays when playing a maze game


//**************************************************************************//

Matlab Project: DataPreprocessing

Src: data_preprocessing.m , for data preprocessing and feature extraction 

     observation.m , for checking the result

InputData: 8 field map text files and 8 corresponding playonfield text files.

OutputData: 8 feature data files, have been put into the StrategyClustering_cpp folder.

Warning: running data_preprocessing takes a lot of time, you can set the k value range at the beginning from 1 to 1. 

//**************************************************************************//

C++ Project: StrategyClustering

Src: Source code folder, including main.cpp, em.cpp, em.h

InputData: 8 data text files generated by matlab, containing the feature extracted

OutputData: 16 data text files, each field has two data text files, for example, for field1, the resulting files
	     are Result1.txt and Plot1.txt, the first one is for checking the clustering result, and the second one
	     is for matlab plotting.

Open the StrategyClustering.dsw, compile and run.
